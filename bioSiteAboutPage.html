            <p>William Hendrix Crandall was born in 1961 in Birmingham, AL. He has lived in various cities throughout the Birmingham metro area, but for the past 24 years, has called Pelham home. He can be described as hard working, driven, resourceful, helpful, fair, goofy, and happy as a clam. He has worked in many different fields throughout his career, starting as a bag boy at Macks Quick Sack in Vestavia when he turned 15. Since then, he has worked as a stable hand for the trail horses at Oak Mountain State Park, a NICU life-line nurse, a pharmaceutical sales representative, the Director of Parks and Recreation for Pelham, and after realizing the retired life was not for him, decided to go back into healthcare as a nurse in the local hospital's psychiatric division. Billyâ€™s favorite things to do are vacation, work around the house, spend time with the dogs and horses, and spend time with his family. His favorite vacation spot is in Merida, Mexico where he used to have a vacation home where he and his family would spend as much time as they could until the pandemic came and halted the ability to get there. In general, he enjoys keeping busy and recently built an inground firepit to complement his newly built pavilion with the help of his son, Sam. The pavilion and firepit are now the hangout spot for his kids and grandkids and provides an amazing place to spend time with the people he loves most. He is an outstanding man and I think everyone should have a Billy Crandall in their life, I know I am lucky to! </p>
